# The Tale of the Lonely Dirac

For as long as it remembered Dirac knew that it was different.
He hated the place and decided to take a long journey and ended up with a place with a long winter, Iowa.  :blush:
He could not find anything in Iowa, just snow, a massive pile of snow. :snowflake:

It liked eating peanut butter and pickle sandwiches and for that it was an outcast, as God intended. 

Meow Meow Cats are the best!
