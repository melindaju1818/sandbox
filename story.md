# The Tale of the Lovely Dirac


For as long as it was remembered Dirac knew that it was different.
He hated the place and decided to take a long journey and ended up in a place with a long winter, Iowa.  :blush:
He could not find anything in Iowa, just snow, a massive pile of snow. :snowflake:


Meow Meow Cats are the best!
Once upon a time,

After he staying at Iowa for 10 dates, he begin to hate winter!


It liked eating peanut butter and pickle sandwiches and for that it was an outcast, as God intended. 

Meow Meow Cats are the best!
Dogs are better lets be honest 

Joe :heart: Dirac distribution


He always wishes summer could come back sooner.
