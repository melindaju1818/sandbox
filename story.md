# The Tale of the Lovely Dirac
For as long as it remembered Dirac knew that it was different.
It dreamed of having a family - lots of the functions it knew had their own family. There were the Uniforms and the Poissons, the Exponentials and everpresent Normals, who claimed that they were related to pretty much everybody. Dirac sighed, and shouldered its backpack to go to school.
I do not know what to add to my storyline at this time!
Just playing around with the stuff.
